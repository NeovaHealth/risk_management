Risk Management

*Business Continuity Management and Risk Management for your Odoo projects*

Manage the risks to your projects in line with your Project Management Approach. Business Continuity Planning as it should be - for small and large organisations. Avoid the 'Buried Word Document Syndrome'. Instead, manage your actions to deal with your risks with Odoo Project Tasks.
